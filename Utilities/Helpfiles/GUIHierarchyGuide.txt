GUI elements will need to deal with a variety of elements and situations. To help keep code organized and event processing in line, we will use a tree design to help coordinate handling of UI elements. 

Global:
   Overall GUI that will be with the player at all times. 

   This will contain things like the Menu button, Debug info, and global notifications. 

Sub-System:
   This GUI will be called by the Global GUI every frame. 

   THERE WILL BE NO OnGUI() CALLS IN THIS FUNCTION!

   Global GUI will maintain the state of the Sub-System GUIs active/inactive status.

Sub-System-Sub-Screen:
   Any mini games or sub menus will be handled here. As with the Sub-System, they will no have OnGUI calls.
